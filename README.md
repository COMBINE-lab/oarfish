# oarfish: Accurate, fast, and versatile transcript quantification from long-read RNA-seq data

Briefly, `oarfish` is a program, written in `rust`, for quantifying transcript-level expression from long-read (i.e. Oxford nanopore cDNA and direct RNA and PacBio) sequencing technologies. 
For more details on `oarfish`, please refer to the [`oarfish` documentation](https://combine-lab.github.io/oarfish).
