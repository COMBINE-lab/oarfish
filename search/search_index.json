It handles multi-mapping reads through the use of probabilistic allocation via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.  Further, it employs many filters to help discard alignments that may reduce quantification accuracy.  Currently, the set of filters applied in <code>oarfish</code> are directly derived from the <code>NanoCount</code><sup>1</sup> tool; both the filters that exist, and the way their values are set (with the exception of the <code>--three-prime-clip</code> filter, which is not set by default in <code>oarfish</code> but is in <code>NanoCount</code>).</p> <p>The usage can be provided by passing <code>-h</code> at the command line.</p> <pre><code>Usage: oarfish [OPTIONS] --alignments &lt;ALIGNMENTS&gt; --output &lt;OUTPUT&gt;\n\nOptions:\n  -a, --alignments &lt;ALIGNMENTS&gt;\n          Name of the person to greet\n  -o, --output &lt;OUTPUT&gt;\n          Location where output quantification file should be written\n  -t, --three-prime-clip &lt;THREE_PRIME_CLIP&gt;\n          [default: 4294967295]\n  -f, --five-prime-clip &lt;FIVE_PRIME_CLIP&gt;\n          [default: 4294967295]\n  -s, --score-threshold &lt;SCORE_THRESHOLD&gt;\n          [default: 0.95]\n  -m, --min-aligned-fraction &lt;MIN_ALIGNED_FRACTION&gt;\n          [default: 0.5]\n  -l, --min-aligned-len &lt;MIN_ALIGNED_LEN&gt;\n          [default: 50]\n  -n, --allow-negative-strand\n\n      --model-coverage\n\n  -t  --threads\n          [default: 1]\n  -q  --short-quant\n              Location where the shore read counts can be read\n  -b  --bins\n          [default: 10]\n  -h, --help\n          Print help\n  -V, --version\n          Print version\n</code></pre> <p>The input should be a <code>bam</code> format file, with reads aligned using <code>minimap2</code> against the transcriptome. That is, <code>oarfish</code> does not currently handle spliced alignment to the genome.  Further, the output alignments should be name sorted (the default order produced by <code>minimap2</code> should be fine).</p> <p>The output is a tab separated file listing the quantified targets, as well as information about their length and other metadata. The <code>num_reads</code> column provides the estimate of the number of reads originating from each target.</p>"},{"location":"#references","title":"References","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Josie Gleeson, Adrien Leger, Yair D J Prawer, Tracy A Lane, Paul J Harrison, Wilfried Haerty, Michael B Clark, Accurate expression quantification from nanopore direct RNA sequencing with NanoCount, Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 50, Issue 4, 28 February 2022, Page e19, https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1129 \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"}]}
