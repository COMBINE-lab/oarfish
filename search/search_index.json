It handles multi-mapping reads through the use of probabilistic allocation via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.  </p> <p>It optionally employs many filters to help discard alignments that may reduce quantification accuracy.  Currently, the set of filters applied in <code>oarfish</code> are directly derived from the <code>NanoCount</code><sup>1</sup> tool; both the filters that exist, and the way their values are set (with the exception of the <code>--three-prime-clip</code> filter, which is not set by default in <code>oarfish</code> but is in <code>NanoCount</code>).</p> <p>Additionally, <code>oarfish</code> provides options to make use of coverage profiles derived from the aligned reads to improve quantification accuracy.  The use of this coverage model is enabled with the <code>--model-coverage</code> flag. You can read more about <code>oarfish</code><sup>2</sup> in the preprint.

The input should be a <code>bam</code> format file, with reads aligned using <code>minimap2</code> against the transcriptome. That is, <code>oarfish</code> does not currently handle spliced alignment to the genome. Further, the output alignments should be name sorted (the default order produced by <code>minimap2</code> should be fine). Specifically, <code>oarfish</code> relies on the existence of the <code>AS</code> tag in the <code>bam</code> records that encodes the alignment score in order to obtain the score for each alignment (which is used in probabilistic read assignment), and the score of the best alignment, overall, for each read. ### Choosing <code>minimap2</code> alignment options Since the purpose of <code>oarfish</code> is to estimate transcript abundance from a collection of alignments to the target transcriptome, it is important that the alignments are generated in a fashion that is compatible with this goal.  Primarily, this means that the aligner should be configured to report as many optimal (and near-optimal) alignments as exist, so that <code>oarfish</code> can observe all of this information and determine how to allocate reads to transcripts.  We recommend using the following options with <code>minimap2</code> when aligning data for later processing by <code>oarfish</code> * For ONT data (either dRNA or cDNA): please use the flags <code>--eqx -N 100 -ax map-ont</code> For PacBio data: please use the flags <code>--eqx -N 100 -ax pacbio</code> Note (1): It may be worthwile using an even larger <code>N</code> value (e.g. the TranSigner manuscript recommends <code>-N 181</code>). A larger value should not diminish the accuracy of <code>oarfish</code>, but it may make alignment take longer and produce a larger <code>bam</code> file.</p> <p>Note (2): For very high quality PacBio data, it may be most appropriate to use the <code>-ax map-hifi</code> flag in place of <code>-ax pacbio</code>.  We are currently evaluating the effect of this option, and also welcome feedback if you have experiences to share on the use of data aligned with these different flags with <code>oarfish</code>.</p>"},{"location":"#other-notes-on-oarfish-parameters","title":"Other notes on <code>oarfish</code> parameters","text":"<p>The parameters above should be explained by their relevant help option, but the <code>-d</code>/<code>--strand-filter</code> is worth noting explicitly. By default, alignments to both strands of a transcript will be considered valid.  You can use this option to allow only alignments in the specified orientation; for example <code>-d fw</code> will allow only alignments in the forward orientation and <code>-d rc</code> will allow only alignments in the reverse-complement orientation and <code>-d both</code> (the default) will allow both.  The <code>-d</code> filter, if explicitly provided, overrides the orientation filter in any provided \"filter group\" so e.g. passing <code>--filter-group no-filters -d fw</code> will disable other filters, but will still only admit alignments in the forward orientation.</p> <p>In general, if you apply a <code>filter-group</code>, the group options will be applied first and then any explicitly provided options given will override the corresponding option in the <code>filter-group</code>.</p>"},{"location":"#inferential-replicates","title":"Inferential Replicates","text":"<p><code>oarfish</code> has the ability to compute inferential replicates of its quantification estimates. This is performed by bootstrap sampling of the original read mappings, and subsequently performing inference under each resampling.  These inferential replicates allow assessing the variance of the point estimate of transcript abundance, and can lead to improved differential analysis at the transcript level, if using a differential testing tool that takes advantage of this information. The generation of inferential replicates is controlled by the <code>--num-bootstraps</code> argument to <code>oarfish</code>.  The default value is <code>0</code>, meaning that no inferential replicates are generated.  If you set this to some value greater than <code>0</code>, the the requested number of inferential replicates will be generated. It is recommended, if generating inferential replicates, to run <code>oarfish</code> with multiple threads, since replicate generation is highly-parallelized. Finally, if replicates are generated, they are written to a <code>Parquet</code>, starting with the specified output stem and ending with <code>infreps.pq</code>.</p>"},{"location":"#output","title":"Output","text":"<p>The <code>--output</code> option passed to <code>oarfish</code> corresponds to a path prefix (this prefix can contain the path separator character and if it refers to a directory that does not yeat exist, that directory will be created).
